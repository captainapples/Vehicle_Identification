## ✨ Features

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- XGBoost
- Tensorflow / Keras

## Detailed Description:

As expected, a tree-based model like XGBoost would perform best/well because they handle outliers and skewed data well.
### ✅ Prerequisites

* 

### 🔧 Possible Changes:
- Contrastive Learning could be explored to improve model performance by creating a more discriminative feature space
